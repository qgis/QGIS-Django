docker-compose.

## Token based authentication

Users can generate a Simple JWT token by providing their credentials, which can then be utilized to access endpoints requiring authentication.
Users can create specific tokens for a plugin at `https://plugins.qgis.org/<package_name>/tokens/`.


```sh
# A specific plugin token can be used to upload or update a plugin version. For example:
curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer the_access_token" \
  https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/api/<package_name>/version/add/ \
  -F "package=@/path/to/valid_plugin_0.0.1.zip"

curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer the_access_token" \
  https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/api/<package_name>/version/<version>/update \
  -F "package=@/path/to/valid_plugin_0.0.2.zip"
```
