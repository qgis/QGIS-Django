QGIS Plugins application

The Plugin model
================

The plugin model represents a QGIS plugin and holds general informations such as title and description and icon.

The plugin can have zero or more *owners* (also named 'collaborators'), *owners* have the same permissions of the original plugin creator.

Permissions
-----------

These rules have been implemented:

* every registered user can add a new plugin
* *staff* users can approve or disapprove all plugin versions
* users which have the special permission `plugins.can_approve` get the versions they upload automatically approved
* users which have the special permission `plugins.can_approve` can approve versions uploaded by others as long as they are in the list of the plugin *owners*
* a particular plugin can be deleted and edited only by *staff* users and plugin *owners*
* if a user without `plugins.can_approve` permission uploads a new version, the plugin version is automatically unapproved.


Trust management
----------------

Staff members can grant *trust* to selected plugin creators setting `plugins.can_approve` permission through the front-end application.

The plugin details view offers direct links to grant trust to the plugin creator or the plugin *owners*.


The PluginVersion model
=======================

Each plugin can have several versions, a version specify the minimum QGIS version needed in order to run that particular plugin version and other informations such as if the version belongs to the "stable" o to the "experimental" branch.

Validation
----------

The validation takes place in the PluginVersions forms, at loading time, the compressed file is checked for:

* file size <= `PLUGIN_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`
* zip contains `__init__.py` in first level dir
* `__init__.py` must contain valid metadata


* `version` must be unique whithin a plugin
* there must be one and only *last* versions in each plugin's branch

At the time of plugin creation, the name of the folder inside the compressed file is stored in the variable `package_name`, this value must be unique and cannot be changed. `package_name` is also used to build SEF URLs, for example the plugin's page for the plugin *Hello World Plugin* with `package_name` *HelloWorld* is `<http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/HelloWorld/>`_

The `package_name` (and hence the first level folder inside the compressed zip file) cannot contain only ASCI letters (A-Z and a-z), digits and the characters underscore (_) and minus (-) and cannot start with a
digit.

Example from the `HelloWorld` plugin compressed zip file::

    Archive:  plugins/tests/HelloWorld/HelloWorld_1.2.zip
